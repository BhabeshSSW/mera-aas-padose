      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Mera Aas Padose</strong> is an arts-integrated initiative aimed at empowering students from BND Public School

        bridges identity gaps faced by immigrant students and fosters a sense of belonging by reconnecting them with their
        cultural heritage.
