      <h2>Reflections and Learnings</h2>
      <p>
        The “Mera Aas Padose” project offered valuable insights into the lived realities of children in low-fee private schools 
        situated in unauthorized colonies. The structured school environment often restricts freedom and expression. 
        Through this project, children were provided space to reflect, express, and take pride in their surroundings.
      </p>
      <p>
        Teachers also reflected on the importance of creative freedom. Their involvement in co-design and facilitation highlighted 
        a need for autonomy and trust within teaching spaces. Many acknowledged how art-based learning opened new possibilities 
        for student engagement.

      <h2>Student Impact</h2>
      <p>
        Students developed stronger confidence, language skills, and the ability to express themselves verbally and visually. 
        They began to see their everyday spaces—homes, streets, schools—as worthy of attention and documentation. 
        This shift in perception was key to building self-worth and cultural awareness.

      <h2>Legacy and Future Directions</h2>
      <p>
        Beyond the final exhibition and performance, the project planted seeds for long-term change. It demonstrated the potential 
        of creative methodologies in classroom environments, especially for marginalized children. With sustained support, 
        such approaches can deepen inclusion, voice, and critical engagement.
      </p>
      <p>
        Future projects can expand on these methods, integrating arts more deeply into curriculum and using storytelling 
        and co-creation to transform education into a collaborative and reflective process.
