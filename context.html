    <h2>Context</h2>
    <p>
      This section provides insight into the location, school setting, and socio-demographic realities that shaped the <strong>Mera Aas Padose</strong> project. Understanding the context is essential to appreciating why this project was necessary and how it impacted its participants.
    </p>

    <h3>1. About BND Public School</h3>
    <p>
      BND Public School is a low-cost private primary school located in the Lal Dora area of Katwaria Sarai, South Delhi. Established in 2000 by a retired Delhi government school teacher, the school serves children from kindergarten through fifth grade. With a small but committed team of 10 teachers and a head teacher, the school aims to provide foundational education to children from underserved backgrounds, particularly those from migrant families.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Mission and Vision</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Mission:</strong> To address the educational challenges faced by primary schools under the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) by fostering academic excellence, critical thinking, and creativity in a safe and inclusive environment.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Vision:</strong> To create a community where every child, regardless of socio-economic status, has access to quality primary education that is culturally rooted, imaginative, and empowering.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Neighborhood Profile: Katwaria Sarai</h3>
    <p>
      Katwaria Sarai is an urban village in South Delhi, officially classified as a “Lal Dora” area—meaning it falls outside of standard development regulations. This contributes to infrastructure challenges such as poor roads, limited sanitation, and intermittent access to utilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite these hardships, the area’s affordability attracts a diverse mix of low- to middle-income families, students, and migrant workers. Its proximity to major universities like JNU and IIT Delhi adds a unique socio-cultural vibrancy to the neighborhood.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Social and Economic Realities</h3>
    <p>
      Most students attending BND Public School come from families engaged in informal labor, street vending, domestic work, or small-scale services. Many live in shared rental housing with minimal space and resources.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this environment, creative expression is often seen as a luxury. The <strong>Mera Aas Padose</strong> project reintroduced art not only as a tool for learning, but also as a means of reclaiming cultural identity, community voice, and emotional well-being.
