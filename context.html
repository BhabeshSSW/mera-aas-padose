      <h2>BND Public School</h2>
      <p>
        BND Public School is a low-cost private primary school situated in the Lal Dora area of Katwaria Sarai, South Delhi.
        It was established in 2000 by a retired Delhi government school teacher and currently caters to students from
        kindergarten to 5th grade. The school employs a small but dedicated team of 10 teachers and administrators.
      </p>
      <p>
        The school focuses on children from marginalized and migrant communities, providing them with foundational education
        in a resource-constrained yet nurturing environment. Its mission is to bridge the educational challenges faced by
        children from underserved backgrounds and to foster academic success through creativity and cultural connection.

      <h2>Katwaria Sarai Neighborhood</h2>
      <p>
        Katwaria Sarai is an urban village in South Delhi, classified as a “Lal Dora” area — exempt from modern development
        regulations. The neighborhood is known for its dense layout, informal economic activity, and lack of consistent
        infrastructure. These conditions result in lower living costs, attracting migrant families and low-income groups.
      </p>
      <p>
        The area's proximity to premier institutions like Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), IIT Delhi, and IIFT lends it
        an academic character, while also fostering a diverse population. Despite infrastructural challenges, the community
        is vibrant, resilient, and full of cultural richness, making it an ideal setting for a project like <em>Mera Aas Padose</em>.
