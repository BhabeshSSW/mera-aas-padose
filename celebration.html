      <h2>Drama Workshop</h2>
      <p>
        As the culmination of the project's expressive journey, students participated in a drama workshop facilitated by an expert. 
        This interactive platform allowed them to reflect on their earlier activities—drawings and models—and bring their thoughts 
        and experiences to life through performance art.
      </p>
      <p>
        Activities included storytelling, improvisation, journaling, and role play. These sessions helped children gain confidence 
        in verbal expression, explore identity, and collaborate with peers in creative ways.

      <h2>Script and Performance</h2>
      <p>
        Children co-created a script based on themes of daily life, challenges, and dreams for a better world. The script emerged 
        organically through dialogue and play. Students acted out stories from their communities—both the joyful and the difficult—
        while imagining future possibilities such as cleaner neighborhoods, more books, and social equality.
