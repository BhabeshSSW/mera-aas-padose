      <h2>Student & Teacher Reflections</h2>
      <p>
        Students shared how the project gave them a voice to express their thoughts, hopes, and frustrations. The freedom to draw, model,
        and perform helped many overcome hesitation and grow in confidence. Teachers noted a shift in how students engaged with school—
        more curiosity, more conversation, more connection.

      <h2>Challenges Faced</h2>
      <p>
        Teachers struggled with letting go of control, as many were used to instructive rather than facilitative roles. Students initially
        found it difficult to draw without direction and sought approval constantly. These moments highlighted the deeply conditioned
        norms of classroom authority and control that the project gently pushed against.

      <h2>Future Vision</h2>
      <p>
        Projects like “Mera Aas Padose” have the potential to reshape education for marginalized communities. Integrating arts with
        curriculum not only improves academic learning but nurtures voice, agency, and cultural pride. Future initiatives could expand
        this approach and advocate for policy-level change in education for underserved populations.
