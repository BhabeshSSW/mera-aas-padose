      <h2>Participatory and Art-Based Approach</h2>
      <p>
        The “Mera Aas Padose” project was designed to foster self-expression and reflection through creative and participatory methods.
        It focused on helping students explore their immediate surroundings—home, school, and neighborhood—through drawing, model-making,
        and drama.
      </p>

      <h2>Drawing and Illustration</h2>
      <p>
        Students were invited to draw their ideas on topics like “My Dream,” “My School,” “My Village,” and “My Way to School.” Teachers were
        trained to support rather than instruct, helping students articulate their thoughts freely. This nurtured creativity and emotional
        confidence.

      <h2>Model-Making</h2>
      <p>
        Based on their drawings, students created 3D models of their school and neighborhood using materials like cardboard, clay, and recycled items.
        These models helped them translate abstract ideas into tangible forms and reflect more deeply on the spaces they inhabit.

      <h2>Collaborative Workshops</h2>
      <p>
        The project involved co-design sessions with teachers, researchers, and artists to align classroom activities with student needs.
        Participatory design helped surface local knowledge and made the curriculum more contextually relevant and engaging.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2>Drama and Reflection</h2>
      <p>
        The final stage involved drama workshops that allowed students to express their experiences and aspirations through performance.
        This phase included storytelling, scriptwriting, and improvisation, encouraging verbal expression and collective reflection.
